# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-16)

**Core value:** Teams can submit any workflow description and receive an accurate, actionable diagnostic -- with team-size-aware analysis -- that reveals bottlenecks, gaps, and automation opportunities they couldn't see before.
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Team-Size-Aware Analysis

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 4 (Team-Size-Aware Analysis)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: Plan 02-01 complete, ready for 02-02
Last activity: 2026-02-16 -- Completed 02-01 team-size-aware scoring engine

Progress: [###░░░░░░░] 25%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 9 min
- Total execution time: 0.15 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 02-team-size-aware-analysis | 1 | 9 min | 9 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-01 (9 min)
- Trend: baseline

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4-phase structure derived from requirement categories (INFR -> TEAM -> AIRE -> REPT)
- [Roadmap]: Testing infrastructure (TEST-01 through TEST-04) deferred to v2 per requirements
- [Roadmap]: Phase 3 (AI Reliability) sequenced after Phase 2 so retry logic covers team-size-aware prompts
- [02-01]: Medium tier uses 1.0 multipliers as neutral baseline for backward compatibility
- [02-01]: Confidence metadata always returned (inferred or high) so consumers never need null checks
- [02-01]: getThresholds accepts null in addition to undefined for defensive caller patterns

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flagged Vercel KV race conditions on workflow:ids array -- needs investigation during Phase 1 planning
- Research flagged per-isolate rate limiting as ineffective in production -- out of v1 scope (distributed rate limiting deferred) but current limits still apply per-isolate
