## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4-phase structure derived from requirement categories (INFR -> TEAM -> AIRE -> REPT)
- [Roadmap]: Testing infrastructure (TEST-01 through TEST-04) deferred to v2 per requirements
- [Roadmap]: Phase 3 (AI Reliability) sequenced after Phase 2 so retry logic covers team-size-aware prompts

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flagged Vercel KV race conditions on workflow:ids array -- needs investigation during Phase 1 planning
- Research flagged per-isolate rate limiting as ineffective in production -- out of v1 scope (distributed rate limiting deferred) but current limits still apply per-isolate
